I am Xiaojian Xu, a 2nd-year Ph.D student in the Computational Imaging Group (CIG) in Department of CSE at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU), advised by [Prof. Kamilov Ulugbek](https://engineering.wustl.edu/Profiles/Pages/Ulugbek-Kamilov.aspx).

Before I came to WashU, I got my B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2014 and then was recommend as a exam-free student to the graduate school of UESTC and later got my M.S. degree there in 2017. Back then, I majored in Communication and Information Engineering and did most of my research in Wireless and Computer Network Engineering. It was a very helpful and interesting journey and I am always appreciate for what I learned in that field. Besides, UESTC is located in Chengdu, a city full of good food lol. I enjoy my seven years living there a lot!

I am always attracted by the beauty of mathematical analysis and I feel so lucky to be able to join the CIG group after I came to WashU. CIG is a pretty cool place and I learned a lot here from my advisor and groupmates. My research of interests includes imaging with deep learning, optimizations algorithms, optimization theory, computational imaging, computer vision and machine learning. Feel free to follow us if you think our research is interesting!
