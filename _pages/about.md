Nice to meet you here!

I am Xiaojian Xu, a 4th-year Ph.D student in the Computational Imaging Group (CIG) from CSE Department at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU), advised by [Prof. Ulugbek Kamilov](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Ulugbek-Kamilov.html).

Before I came to WashU, I got my B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2014 and then was recommend as an exam-free student to the graduate school of UESTC and later got my M.S. degree there in 2017. I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Computational Imaging Group in Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA. My research interests include computational imaging, optimization theory, computer vision and deep learning. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in our research!

Back then, I majored in communication and information engineering and did most of my research in wireless and computer network engineering. It was a very helpful and interesting journey and I always appreciate what I have learned in that field. Besides, UESTC is located in Chengdu, a city full of good food. I enjoied my seven years there a lot!
I am always attracted by the beauty of mathematical analysis and I feel so lucky to be able to join the CIG group after I came to WashU. CIG is a pretty cool place and I learned a lot here from my advisor and groupmates. My research of interests includes computational imaging, optimization theory,computer vision and machine learning. Feel free to follow us if you think our research is interesting!
