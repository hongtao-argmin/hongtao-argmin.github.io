I am Xiaojian Xu, a 2nd-year Ph.D student in the Computitational Imaging Group (CIG) in Department of CSE at Washington University in St. Louis, advised by [Dr. Kamilov Ulugbek](https://engineering.wustl.edu/Profiles/Pages/Ulugbek-Kamilov.aspx). 

Before I came to WashU,  I got my B.Eng degree from University of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2014 and was recommend as a exam-free student to the graduate school of UESTC and later got my M.S. degree there in 2017. Back then, I majored in Communication and Information Enginering and did most of my research in Wirless and Computer Network Engineering. It was a very helpful and interesting journey in and I am always appreaciate for what I learned in that field.

I am always attracted by the beauty of mathmetical analysis and I feel very luck to be able to joined the CIG group. CIG is a pretty cool place and I learned a lot here from my advisor and groupmates.My research of interests include imaging with deep learning, optimizations algorithms, optimization theory, computional imgaing, computer vision and machine learning. Feel free to follow us if you think our research is interesting!
